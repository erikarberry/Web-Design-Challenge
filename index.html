          <p>For learning to occur in a classroom, students need to be engaged and know that they are safe and supported
            by the adults in their school building. </p> <br>
          <p>School discipline should not be viewed as a way to manage students and deliver a punishment, but instead a
            chance to grow students in reinforcing expectations. If a school community has intentionally set the
            expectation that certain behaviors are not in alignment with a positive school culture, students will strive
            to meet the high expectations that the educators in their lives have set for them. </p>
          <p>School leaders must be intentional about creating safe and supportive schools and ensuring students are
            engaged in their own personalized learning journey. From the teacher who manages a classroom, to the school
            board members who approve the official Codes of Conduct, to all families who desire to have their students
            engaged in class and learning at the highest levels every day, every member of a school community must
            believe that school discipline is simply a means to an end and that the schools which our students attend
            are deserving of those students.</p> <br>

          <p>On this site, we will explore a few relationships and interesting outcomes related to school discipline and
            academic outcomes. The data on this site is from the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (NCDPI)
            for the 2018-2019 academic year. All data was reported to NCDPI by each local school district (LEA) in the
            state. </p> <br>
